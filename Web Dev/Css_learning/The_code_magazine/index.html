            All mordern websites and web applications are build using three <em>fundamental</em> Technologies- HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
            These are the languages of the web. <!-- <i> tag is old and has no meaning so it it replaced by <em> emphasise tag -->

            In this post, let's focus on HTML.
            We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you should learn it.
        </p>

          <h3> What is HTML? </h3>
          <p>
            HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage.
            It's a markup language that developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage.
            (not a programming language). <q>It is called the skeleton of the web.</q> &nbsp; Without HTML, the while internet does not exists!
          </p>

          <p>
            HTML consists of elements that describe the different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc.
            Web browsers understand HTML code as websites.
          </p>

          <blockquote> <!-- blockquote is usedto quote paragraghs but here it added space in the paragraph -->
            <p>
              In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li> The opening tag </li>
              <li> The closing tag </li>
              <li> The actual element </li>
            </ol>
          </blockquote>
